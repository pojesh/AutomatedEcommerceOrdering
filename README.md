# UiPath Automated E-Commerce Ordering Process

This repository contains a UiPath automation project designed to process product orders from an Excel file received via email. The robot performs end-to-end web automation on the "Swag Labs" e-commerce test site ([saucedemo.com](https://www.saucedemo.com)) to place orders, then updates and replies to the original email with the results.
